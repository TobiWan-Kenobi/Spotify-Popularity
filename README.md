Building a NN to predict which song will be popular, and then understanding the drivers of popularity

Outcome: Seems like a NN is overpowered for the data. The NN does not find any patterns, and just predicts the average (with a squared residuals loss function) or the median (with 
a MAE loss function) for every example.

I keep this repo here anyway, as to have a hard-coded NN in my repos
